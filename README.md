Having good agile systems for development will suit me, as I do not perform well under pressure, but excell in well structured envirnoments. Creating frontend projects aligns well with my creative side, so being a bit more involved in the UI/UX components will be good. I am also a logical thinker who enjoyes working with systems and improving them. My skills, interests, and values definately aligns more with smaller teams and working in a structured creative environment.
